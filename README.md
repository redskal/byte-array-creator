###### _Generate a C# exploit skeleton from shellcode .BIN file_

A small tool I originally cobbled together in 2012 when I was trying to move my toolset over to the .NET framework.

Typically if I write my own shellcode I use NASM and generate a .BIN file. This tool was used to generate exploit skeletons from those shellcode files. It doesn't have the catchiest name but it wasn't ever really supposed to be public and 'bac' is quick to type!

This tool was also the predecessor of my 'DDC' tool which I will be releasing soon.
